    <p>Hello! my name is David, and I'm from California. I'm a software engineering major. I'm a single pringle, and I'm currently focusing on my education right now, so I don't have a job. I'm taking this course because it's required for my major, but besides that, I am genuinely interested in HTML, web design, and how it differs from Python. My favorite genre of music right now (subject to change) is symphonic metal. You should listen to "Last Ride of the Day" by Nightwish if you want to know what that means. <br><br>
        I've been a member of the Church my whole life, but I was truly converted in high school when I decided to find out if all of that stuff I was taught was true. I didn't want to rely on other's thoughts or opinions, so I told no one about my quest for truth and searched and prayed for myself. And I got a confirmation, or two, or twenty. It's paved the way for many more blessings, and I'm grateful I did it. <br><br>
    </p>
